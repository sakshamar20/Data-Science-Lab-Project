## 1.Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

The increasing competitiveness of postgraduate programs has made the process of choosing a good program at a reputable university difficult and requires a thorough understanding of application trends and patterns.
This analysis aims to provide an insight on academic institutions to help applicants in their admission processes.

### 1.2 Questions We imposed

-   What Majors are students preferring?
-   How many students prefer changing their majors from UnderGrad to PostGrad?
-   Which Universities are preferred for a particular major?
-   What are the *Admit/Reject* chances?
-   Does **CGPA** really matters?
-   How much does the factors like writing papers and and having work experience affect the Admit chances?
 

### 1.3 Scope of Analysis

The study covers data of 100 students from IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee, IIT Guwahati with different Degrees applying for Post-Graduation in different foreign Universities and then based on their *CPI/CGPA*, *UG College* and *Degree*, *GRE* and *TOEFL/IELTS* scores and work experience whether their application got accepted or rejected.


### 2. Explaing the dataset

#### 2.1 Overview of the dataset

Our project consists of the data of various students from different Colleges and Degrees applying for Post-Graduation in Foreign Universities and then based on their *CPI/CGPA*, *UG College* and *Degree, GRE* and *TOEFL* scores and work experience whether their application got accepted or rejected.As of now, we have scraped data of these colleges : IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee, IIT Guwahati For each college, we have scraped data of 100 students.

#### 2.2 Problems with the dataset

The analysis of the scraped dataset revealed notable challenges, primarily centered around data completeness and potential sample bias.
A significant concern emerged from the observation that a mere 2% of applicants had provided IELTS scores and was completely not assigned to any particular university we got the data for which is why removing it did not affect the dataset.

The data with IELTS score column : 

![](img2.jpg)


Moreover, it was evident that not all rejected applicants had entered their data, creating an incomplete representation of the entire applicant pool introducing the possibility of selective sample bias.
As such, caution has been be exercised when drawing conclusions or making inferences based on this dataset, and efforts to address these data gaps should be prioritized to enhance the robustness and reliability of subsequent analyses.
We have tried to solve the problems in the dataset by preprocessing it.

## 3. Data Scraping and Methodology

### 3.1 Data Sources

The dataset comprises application records from the Website: <https://admits.fyi/>

changed_major_data <- data %>% group_by(data$UG.MAJOR != data$TARGET.MAJOR)

# Count the occurrences of each Target Major
major_counts <- changed_major_data %>% count(TARGET.MAJOR)
major_counts <- major_counts %>%
  mutate(Percent = n / sum(n) * 100)

# Create a bar plot with different colors for each bar
p <- ggplot(data = major_counts, aes(x = reorder(TARGET.MAJOR, -n), y = n, fill = TARGET.MAJOR)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "white") +
  scale_fill_discrete() +  # This line ensures different colors for each bar
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "UG Major Changes to Target Major", x = "Target Major", y = "Count") +

```

## 5. Conclusion

-   Most of the students preferred majors that are related to *Computer Science*, *Artificial Intelligence*, *Machine Learning* and *Data Science*.

-   Higher **CGPA** does matter in the process of admission if you aim for an *IVY League* University.

-   Having a paper or some work experience does improve your chances of *Admit*.

-   Even though there is a cutoff on **GRE/TOEFL** scores, but having a **320+/105+** significantly improves the chances of admit.
